## Bayesian inference framework for reweighting conformational ensembles using cryo-EM particles

Here, we present an ensemble refinement framework that estimates the ensemble density from a set of cryo-EM particles by reweighting a prior ensemble of conformations, e.g., from molecular dynamics simulations or structure prediction tools.
